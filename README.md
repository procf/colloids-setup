# PRO-CF Colloids Simulation Setup Guide

Welcome to the PRO-CF Colloids simulation team! :tada:

This is a set-up guide for running colloids simulations in our group using the [HOOMD-blue] simulation toolkit.

## Before you Begin

The [System Setup folder](/System-Setup) contains information for choosing a laptop or other workstation and steps for setting up a new MacOS computer before installing HOOMD-blue.

The [Programming Resources folder](/Programming-Resources) contains a variety of resources that can help you with the command line, VIM, Python, R, C++, Git/Github, and other skills that are useful for our work.

Once you have received and set up your computer, the remaining files should help you install HOOMD-blue and VMD and give you the information you need to get started with colloids simulations!

## Installing Software and Running Simulations

These guides are numbered to follow the steps for getting set up with HOOMD-blue, VMD, and other related tools for running and analyzing simulation data:

1. The HOOMD-blue Installation Guide (*to be updated for v3.0+*)

2. An introduction to running HOOMD-blue simulations: Simulating waterDPD (*to be updated for v3.0+*)

3. [The VMD Installation Guide](/03-VMD-Install-Guide.md)

4. An introdcution to visualizing `.gsd` files in VMD: [Using VMD](/04-Using-VMD.md)

5. The guide to analyzing `.log` files in R: [Log Analysis with R](/05-Log-Analysis-with-R.md)

6. An overview of the steps involved in colloid gelation and shearing (*to be updated for v3.0+*)

7. A full guide to post-processing simulation data (*to be linked to Nabi's post-processing R Notebook*)

8. [The Guide to Accessing "Discovery"](/08-Accessing-Discovery.md) (Northeastern's HPC cluster)

9. An [introduction to running HPC simulations](/09-Slurm-and-Disco.md)
