# Rheoinformatic Colloids Simulation Setup Guide

Welcome to the Rheoinformatic colloids simulation team! :tada:

These files will guide you through everything you need to know to start running colloid simulations with [HOOMD-blue] for research in our group.

## Before you Begin

If you are ordering or setting up a new computer:
* The [System Setup folder](/System-Setup) contains information for choosing a laptop or other workstation, and steps for setting up a new MacOS computer before installing HOOMD-blue.

If you are new to programming:
* The [Programming Resources folder](/Programming-Resources) contains some references that can help you get started the command line, VIM, Python, R, C++, Git/Github, and other skills that are useful for our work.

The remaining files will help you install HOOMD-blue and VMD and start running colloid simulations.
