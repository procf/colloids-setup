# HOOMD-blue Installation and Setup Guide

*to be added*

This is a guide to installing [HOOMD-blue] v3.0+ for use in the PRO-CF Colloids Team. Our implementation of HOOMD-blue is currently CPU only (no GPU components) and includes several modifications to the base code specifically for colloidal gels.

This guide is optizimed for MacOS.

[Last Update: June 2022]

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh and streamlined and adapted for MPI by Dr. Deepak Mangal. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.
