# Example sbatch scripts for running simulations on the Discovery HPC cluster

1. job-waterDPD: run waterDPD.py on hoomd3.1-basic
2. job-shear-waterDPD: run shear-waterDPD.py on hoomd3.1.-mod
3. analyze: run extractdata-waterDPD.py as an sbatch job
4. plotter: run plot-kT.py or plot-shearstress.py as an sbatch job
